Computer applications of linear algebra using NumPy

These programs require Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and NumPy (https://numpy.org/). 
An application like PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is the most convenient way to edit inputs and view outputs and provides an easy path for installing NumPy.

interpoly.py takes an arbitrary set of points and returns coefficients for a polynomial that passes through all of them using a Vandermonde matrix.

rref.py takes a matrix of arbitrary size and returns it in reduced row echelon form.
